# Arduino Library for the Fri3d Camp Badge

This library offers simple interfaces to the hardware peripherals on the Fri3d Camp Badge so you can program the badge using the Arduino IDE and related programming environments. You can find more information on the badge at http://fri3d.be/badge

## Installation

### Arduino Library for the Fri3d Camp badge

Download this repo as a .ZIP file and install it, similar to other Arduino libraries: https://www.arduino.cc/en/Guide/Libraries#toc4

### ESP32 Board for the Fri3d Camp badge

#### Windows users

Download the repo from https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 as a .ZIP file and unzip it to an `espressif/esp32` directory in your `Mydocuments\Arduino\hardware` folder.

Run `get.exe` (make sure to run this as administrator), found in the `esp32/tools` folder.

#### Mac and Linux users

Download the repo from https://github.com/espressif/arduino-esp32 as a .ZIP file and unzip it to an `espressif/esp32` directory in your Home directory.

Run the `tools/get.py` python script to download the tools. Using a terminal, navigate to the `esp32/tools` folder and run `python get.py`.

The `get.py` python script will download the Xtensa GNU tools and the ESP32 software development kit (SDK), and unzip them to the proper location. You should see a few new folders in the `tools` directory, including `sdk` and `xtensa-esp32-elf` once itâ€™s done.

## Usage

When the ESP32 board and this library have been installed, the ESP boards (under `Tools/Board`) and Fri3d Camp Badge examples (under `File/Examples`) should be available in your Arduino IDE.

In order to flash code to your badge:

* Connect the badge to your computer with a USB cable
* Select the `ESP32 Dev Module` board under `Tools/Board` 
* Set your port to the correct port under `Tools/Port`. On a modern MacBook Pro, this port is `/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART`.
* You can now upload Arduino programs to the Fri3d Camp badge.
* Explore the examples for sample Arduino code for the Fri3d Camp badge unnder `File > Examples > Fri3dBadge`

### Library support

This library offers various classes to easily interface with the peripherals on board the Fri3d Camp badge. The following classes are available:

* `Fri3dAccelerator` supports the ADXL345 accelerometer, using Adafruit's Sensor classes. The `1.Basics/accelerometer` demonstrates its usage.
* `Fri3dButtons` supports the two buttons and two touchpads with `getButton` and `getTouchpad` functions. The `1.Basics/buttons` example shows how to check the button and touchpad states.
* `Fri3dBuzzer` supports the buzzer with `setFrequency` (0-1000s) and `setVolume` (0-255) functions. Check `1.Basics/buzzer` for example code.
* `Fri3dMatrix` supports the LED matrices with `setPixel` and `getPixel` functions on a 14x5 screen buffer. The matrix runs a thread in the background to render the LED matrix. See the `1.Basics/matrix` example for a basic setup and the `1.Basics/font` example for a scrolling text demo.
* `Fri3dServoJewel` supports servo motors, using the Servo Jewel add-on board that comes with the Fri3d Camp robot kit. Check `3.Jewels/OneServo` and `3.Jewels/TwoServos` examples for demos.

## Problems & solutions

### Uploading the badge does not work
* Make sure the battery is switched off. If this does not work unplug the badge from your pc and plug it back in. Now it should work.

### I get errors concerning multiple wifi stacks
* Make sure you have the latest version of arduino IDE installed, most of the development was done using version 1.8.5
